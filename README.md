# Komodo

### A stack based language made in C++

```
push 35 -- adds 35 
push 34 -- adds 34

plus -- adds them all together

dump -- dumps it all to the console

pop_all -- removes all results from top to bottom

dump -- dumps all and it should push a error because theres nothing in the stack
```
